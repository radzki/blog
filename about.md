## $ whoami

Hey, I'm **Gabriel Radzki** — a computer engineer working as a software engineer and reverse engineering enthusiast (lots of engineering!!) based in Porto Alegre, Brazil.

By day, I build things at [Mindbody](https://www.mindbody.io/). By night (and weekends), I take things apart — firmware, binaries, IoT devices, whatever catches my curiosity. Sometimes I even put them back together.

This blog is where I document my adventures: firmware mods for abandoned hardware, protocol decoding, embedded shenanigans, and the occasional "I did this so you don't have to" writeup.
